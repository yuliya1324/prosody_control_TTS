# Prosody Control in Speech Synthesis

*by Yuliya Korotkova*

### Comparison of TTS systems

These examples show the difference between three types of TTS models compared in Side-by-Side testing.

**Baseline**: model trained without prosodic markup.

**Ground Truth**: model trained with prosodic markup, and samples are generated with ground truth labels.

**Text Prediction**: model trained with prosodic markup, and samples are generated with labels predicted by text.

### Controlability

These examples show how the identical text can be pronounced differently with prosodic markup modifications.
